# WeatherApp

# NOTE
If the app doesn't search for the location and you get a HTTPRequest error in the developer console, you must disable the CORS policy in your browser. 
eg. In Safari you must enable Developer Tab from Advanced Preferences and withing the Develop Tab you must Disable Cross-Origin Restrictions.

This is a restriction caused by the API source.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
